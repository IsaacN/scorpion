		                    <p class="lead">
		                        One of the core components of a Hot Shots based program is the innovated, practical philosophy called "learning through play." Hotshots classes are designed to be fun, tactical, skills and social. At Scorpion, kids are encouraged to serve, rally and score, refining their skills through playing tennis. At the same time, they can learn how to build their teamwork skill and show sportsmanship during game play.</p>

		                        At Scorpion, we recognise the challenges of kids who are trying tennis for the very first time. It is therefore important for them to have a modified set of equipment that is practical and suitable for their levels and physical abilities.
		                        <br>
		                        We believe that kids will be encouraged to learn through play with the provided equipment from Tennis Australia, including the smaller racquets and low-compression ball courts, together with our accredited and passionate coaches.
